## configurations with a security impact

There are configuration methods and standards with security impact established to make the digital environment more secure and protect information from security threats and vulnerabilities.

This README provides a list of security configurations impacting either users or repositories, each configuration includes details on how to detect and automatically fix these configurations. Additionally, each configuration is associated with a compliance category from NIST.

### 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
#### Impact:
decreases the scope of vulnerability of unauthorized access
#### Automated Detection and Fix:
Implement an automated system to enforce 2FA for all users.
#### NIST Compliance Category:
